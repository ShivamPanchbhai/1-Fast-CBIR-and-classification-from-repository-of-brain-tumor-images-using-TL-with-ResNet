# Fast-CBIR-and-classification-from-repository-of-brain-tumor-images-using-TL-with-ResNet
This project is done as a part of 1st semester ME curriculum. The main objective is to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting and localizing brain tumors
based on MRI scans. In this project I have trained 2 AI models 1) RESNET 2) RESUNET.  The main objective of RESNET model was to detect brain tumor by processing 
the MRI image. The RESUNET model was used for finding where exactly the brain tumor is present in the MRI image.  
After training our both models, we come to a single result of brain MRI with tumor mask on it and then compared that result with the already available result. 
We were available to achieve an accuracy of 98%.
